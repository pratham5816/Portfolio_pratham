I am a quick learner with a self-learning attitude.I am deeply fascinated by the intricacies of coding, particularly the step-by-step process involved in parsing a string within a compiler and the functioning of automata. Currently, I am in my fourth year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and actively seeking job opportunities that align with my technical expertise and daily programming experience. I have a strong passion for Java and have been working with it consistently for nearly a year.",
